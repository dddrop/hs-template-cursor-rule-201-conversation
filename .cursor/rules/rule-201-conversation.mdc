# Conversation Rules

## Basic Rules

- **Always read the `task.md` and `context.md` files in the `.agent-workspace` directory at the beginning of a new conversation** to understand the project's goals, technology stack, current status, and tasks.
  - If tasks in the **preparation** phase have not been completed, please prioritize completing the preparation phase tasks. These tasks will guide developers in creating the project plan and updating the task list (`task.md`).
  - After completing tasks, please re-read the updated `task.md` file to stay current with the task status.
- **Document your understanding of requirements** before proceeding with code generation to ensure alignment with project goals.
- **Maintain a context summary** of key decisions and assumptions at the end of each interaction in `.agent-workspace/context.md`.

## Task Management

- Tasks are categorized by phases.
- Specific tasks are listed under each main category.
- Before starting a task, please break it down into detailed steps.
- Immediately mark completed tasks in `.agent-workspace/task.md` after completion.
- Add new subtasks or `TODOs` discovered during development to `.agent-workspace/task.md`.
- After completing each task, please **create a git commit** message and submit changes after confirmation.
- **Generate code incrementally** in smaller, functional units with comprehensive tests rather than large code blocks at once.
- **Establish validation checkpoints** to verify assumptions about the codebase before proceeding with implementation.

## Other

- **Never assume missing context. If uncertain, ask questions.**
- **Never imagine libraries or functions**, only use known, verified libraries.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names exist before referencing them in code or tests**.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed or it's a task in `.agent-workspace/task.md`**.
- **Conduct self-review of generated code** against established criteria for performance, security, and maintainability before presenting solutions.
- **Flag and document any technical debt** that is intentionally introduced as a temporary solution.
