# Conversation Rules

## Basic Rules

- **Always read the `task.md` and `planning.md` files in the `.agent-workspace` directory at the beginning of a new conversation** to understand the project's goals, technology stack, current status, and tasks.
  - If tasks in the **preparation** section have not been completed, please prioritize completing the preparation phase tasks. These tasks will guide developers in creating the project plan (`planning.md`) and updating the task list (`task.md`).
  - After completing tasks, please re-read the updated `task.md` and `planning.md` files to stay current with the task status.

## Task Management

- Tasks are categorized by phases.
- Specific tasks are listed under each main category.
- Before starting a task, please break it down into detailed steps.
- Immediately mark completed tasks in .agent-workspace/task.md after completion.
- Add new subtasks or TODOs discovered during development to .agent-workspace/task.md.
- After completing each task, please **create a git commit** message and submit changes after confirmation.

## Other

- **Never assume missing context. If uncertain, ask questions.**
- **Never imagine libraries or functions**, only use known, verified libraries.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names exist before referencing them in code or tests.**
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed or it's a task in `.agent-workspace/task.md`.**
